This is part of a project using C# for our final assignment of the Programming II Module. 

Welcome to I.C.Treats, Singapore's inaugural robotic ice cream store, where the future meets sweetness.
Our fully automated ice cream parlour, led by the diligent Otto the Friendly Robot Scooper, brings you a unique ice cream experience.
Choose from a variety of serving styles ‚Äì cup, cone, or waffle, all skillfully "handmade" by Otto. Each option allows customization with 1-3 scoops from a tempting array of regular and premium flavors.
Indulge in delightful add-ons, from toppings like sprinkles and mochi to specialty waffles in red velvet, charcoal, or pandan. Our loyal customers enjoy exclusive perks through our membership program.
Start as an ordinary member, then level up to silver or gold as you accumulate points.
Points are earned with every purchase, with a conversion rate that rewards your loyalty. Silver and gold members can redeem points to offset their bills, while gold members receive priority treatment in our special order queue.
All paying customers receive a PointCard upon registration, unlocking the potential for fantastic rewards. With a punch card system in place, every 10 ice creams ordered earns you the 11th one for free. 
It's our way of sweetening the deal for our dedicated patrons. Otto meticulously manages the orders, ensuring they are prepared in sequence and released only when perfection is achieved.
Keep an eye out for special treats on your birthday ‚Äì the first ice cream in your birthday order is on the house! Interested in the code behind this innovative ice cream experience?
Enjoy the scoop of the future at I.C.Treats! üç¶‚ú®
